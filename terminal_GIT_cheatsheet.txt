GIT COMMANDS:

git config --global user.name "name name" (Sets global user name, remove --global to just use it for currenct git directory)
git config user.email(Shows email,)
git config --global user.email "email" (Sets user email, remove --global to just use it for currenct git directory)


------------------------------------------------------------

1. git status (shows all info about the current repo,which branch you're currently on
which files have been modified, added, or deleted since the last commit
which files are staged and ready to be committed
any untracked files that are not yet being tracked by Git)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

2.git init(initialize git repo)

------------------------------------------------------------------

3.git log (shows you all the commits, branches of the commits and shows you who commited them )
tags:
--oneline (shortens the long git ref but still shows all the commits with the message and branches of teh commits)

-------------------------------------------------------------------

4.git commit <tags> (basically groups all the chosen changes to the repo and makes a checkpoint,
almost the same as saving but git does not save, only remembers the chosen files/folders
that was added and commited, without -m it will open another editor)
tag:
-m (for messages)
-am (commits all files that is being watched without staging them, but you have to had commited
them before)
--amend (for mistakes, if u messed up on the prev commit like the message or forgot to 
stage a file, then just stage them and run this u can retype the message and commit the new staged
items)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

5.git add <file> (staging the files/folders of your choice, this is the first step to commiting)

----------------------------------------------------

6.git rm --cached <file>(removes files/folders that were staged with "git add")

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. git branch (shows all the branches of the repository)
tags:
<name> (makes a new branch{BUT IT DOES NOT SWITCH TO IT})
 -D <name> (delete branch but be careful since it uses --force)
 -m <name> (Rename branch)
 -v (gives more info like last commits on all branches)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.git switch <branch>(switches to a specific branch)

tags:
-c <branch name> (Makes AND switches to that branch)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.git merge <branch name> (OH BOY. ok the current HEAD branch merges with the <branch name>.
A fast forward merge is a merge where the SELECTED HEAD does not have any commits when you merge it with
<branch name> that has commits{ its simply catches up})
(When resolving conflicts,after resolving you need to add and commit again to save your fix then everything is merged 


correctly)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.git diff (shows the diff between files. If you run this as is then it will show you the diff between your last commit and the current UNSTAGED saved files, also it does not show
for untracked files)

TAGS:
HEAD (shows the same as the above BUT for every change since your last commit even staged changes but still not for the tracked files)
--staged/--cached (shows you the diff between last commit and all the STAGED files)
<filename> (you can choose which file to see differences, can be used with --staged and HEAD to be specific)
branch1..branch2 (shows diff between branches)
commit1..commit2 (this should be in ref form, so basically (f4223r43..fewe32fewef) as an example but this will show you the diff between two commits
